# World-Covid-19-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on World Covid-19 Data 

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This dataset includes time series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including:

* confirmed tested cases of Coronavirus infection
* the number of people who have reportedly died while sick with Coronavirus
* the number of people who have reportedly recovered from it

### Data
The Data is in CSV format and updated daily. It is sourced from [this upstream repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) maintained by the amazing team at [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://systems.jhu.edu/) (CSSE) who have been doing a great public service from an early point by collating data from around the world.

### Note:
Recently, some of the countries have stopped reporting Covid-19 data so most of the Data is deficient and inaccurate. However, the analysis was done based on the data provided
* Active Cases are calculated based on recoveries so this will not be also correct
* Anything that requires recoveries in the calculation isn't 100% correct, like deaths/100recoveries, etc.
* Most of these reports are based on the US but mostly it is true for the rest of the world.
